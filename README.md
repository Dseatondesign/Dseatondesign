I bring a unique blend of experience spanning user-centered design, spatial 3D interfaces, regulatory compliance, and B2B SaaS product development, with a focus on regulated industries like health tech and proptech.

With a foundation in building design and compliance, I understand how physical, digital, and legal systems intersect — enabling me to craft intuitive, compliant experiences for complex platforms.

In addition to traditional UX, I have hands-on experience designing for 3D spatial environments and tools that integrate spatial data, which gives me an edge in projects involving geospatial data, digital twins, or immersive experiences.

My strong research skills allow me to confidently conduct user interviews, synthesize insights into actionable design decisions, and map user journeys across complex workflows.

In the health tech space, I’ve conducted independent research into wearable technology through my work with DropBio, focusing on how to present health data in privacy-conscious, actionable ways. Whether tackling spatial challenges in proptech or simplifying health data interactions, I align user needs, business goals, and compliance requirements.

I’m proficient in Figma for design collaboration, prototyping, and design system management. I thrive in cross-functional teams where research-driven design decisions intersect with regulatory frameworks.

I’m excited to contribute my systems thinking, compliance awareness, and research-driven design expertise to forward-thinking teams solving real-world problems.
